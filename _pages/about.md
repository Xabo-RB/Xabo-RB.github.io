Mechanical engineer by training at the University of Vigo. I continued my education with a Master’s Degree in Industrial Mathematics with a specialization in mathematical modelling from the University of Santiago in 2022. I finished these studies with my master’s thesis about systems biology and structural identifiability.

I am currently a Ph.D. student at the Department of Systems Engineering and Control of the University of Vigo under the supervision of Dr. Alejandro F. Villaverde. My doctoral research focuses on applied mathematics for nonlinear control systems, particularly in regard to structural identifiability analysis. The main area of application is immunology, in which I am co-supervised by Jose Faro Rivas (CINBIO, Universidade de Vigo).

I have complemented my doctoral training with international research stays. I spent two months at the Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência (IGC) in Lisbon, working on investigations in species ecology. I am currently conducting a research stay at the University of Tokyo, focusing on topic modelling in T-cell repertoires.
