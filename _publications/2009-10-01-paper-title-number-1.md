title: "Benchmarking tools for a priori identifiability analysis1"
collection: publications
excerpt: "The theoretical possibility of determining the state and parameters of a dynamic model by measuring its outputs is given by its structural identifiability and its observability. These properties should be analysed before attempting to calibrate a model, but their a priori analysis can be challenging, requiring symbolic calculations that often have a high computational cost. In recent years, a number of software tools have been developed for this task, mostly in the systems biology community. These tools have vastly different features and capabilities, and a critical assessment of their performance is still lacking"
